**Focus Over Fear: helping your child enjoy tough challenges instead of fearing them**

When a child refuses to do schoolwork, one reason that is often overlooked is fear. In this article, we&#39;ll outline a few signs that might indicate your child fears academic challenges and four ways to help them overcome that fear. These strategies can help your child become a &quot;shark&quot; academically while building confidence in other areas as well.

**Help a child enjoy tough challenges instead of fearing them**

This pandemic has given us a first-hand look at how our children learn. We have all now had the opportunity to play teacher. If your family is like ours, you may have had a few successes, but also your share of tears and tantrums!

My eight-year-old son found every way possible to avoid his daily assignments. At first, it was sneaking snacks or watching TV. As soon as we noticed these tricks, we told him to sit down and work on his online assignments. He listened, but he kept clicking on everything but his work. We offered him video games in exchange for finishing his math assignment. He began to work. A short time later, he exploded with anger and tears and yelling &quot;this is impossible&quot;.

Parents have all experienced the frustration of asking their children to do something and then having them refuse. Our initial reaction may be to call these refusals whining, bad behavior, or failure to obey. For some children, however, the root of refusing may be fear. If a child is afraid, then dealing with their fear may look very different from dealing with other reasons for refusal.

**What can you do to make a scared child confident?**

The first step to helping your child overcome fear is to recognize it. A child who may fear academic work may show the following signs:

- Ignore difficult assignments.
- Turn down the assignment regardless of the reward.
- Physical signs of fear including sweating, a fast heart rate, a flushed face, and being hyperaware of their surroundings.
- Irritability or explosive behaviors when forced to do an assignment.
- Self-hatred or self-injury when they feel trapped or fail at an assignment. This may include hitting their head or scratching themselves with negative self-talk.
- Reliance on comfort toys, food, or other activities to avoid work.
- Lack of follow through or giving up partway through an assignment.
- Reluctance to work with peers or teachers who might discover the child&#39;s struggles.

If you recognize a few of these signs in your child, it is likely that the core issue is fear. There may be other reasons, including weaknesses in the actual material or oppositional behavior, but addressing their fears may be the first step toward success.

Children may be fearful of schoolwork for a variety of reasons, many of which may seem irrational to parents. Perhaps a child had a bad learning experience with a teacher or peer. If a student notices that other students can master a certain assignment much faster than they can, they may feel inadequate. Even the mental energy it takes to overcome the negative or frustrating feeling when trying to solve a hard problem may discourage some children from trying again. It is then possible for the fear to take on a life of its own even if the original reason disappears.

After lots of trial and error, I have outlined four steps that I recommend for parents to help their child go from a fear mentality to what I call a &quot;shark&quot; mentality for academics. I think these steps can speak for themselves, but I have given more details for each step below. It is also common that after working through these steps, you might uncover more about your child that needs attention.

The four steps are:

1. Find the minimum &quot;dose&quot; of schoolwork your child can do easily
2. Emphasize the process, not the end goal
3. Tie increased confidence in academics with other things that a child enjoys
4. Have only a single repeatable process for a child to be rewarded for their success to develop &quot;muscle memory&quot;

**Work with your child**

Many parents are interested in working with their child on a difficult assignment, but struggle with the best way to do it. Sometimes the pressure of working directly with a child who is struggling can make things worse!

Humans, in general, tend to make more mistakes under pressure or when they feel afraid than when they feel safe. Getting your child to feel safe with you is the first step to helping him or her. By removing their fear, they can open their minds to new ways of solving problems. Having a child feel safe with you when he or she is doing schoolwork is quite different from being someone they can always turn to for assistance. Children who find a way to have you &quot;do&quot; their work have not overcome their fear!

Busy parents often queue up work for their kids. They may set a certain reward for finishing a set of assignments by the end of the day. Most parents quickly find out that many assignments remain incomplete, or you might find out that your child didn&#39;t really tell you the whole story.

For most parents, the easiest way to understand what your child can and cannot do is to simply do the assignment yourself and let them help you. This takes the pressure off your child, but also gives you a better sense of what may be going wrong just from what they chose to tell you. I found that my child was making tiny errors on his calculations, but that led to the wrong answer over and over, leading to lots of frustration. We learned together to focus on the immediate calculation and to write down our work. He said later that he &quot;liked having my brain power nearby.&quot;

Taking turns is a another practical way to make a child feel safe while also giving them plenty of responsibilities. In addition, this is an excellent way to model problem-solving strategies and how to tolerate frustration. In addition, the child now has a real example of the &quot;fight&quot; you have been in together. You might, for example, print off 20 math problems off the internet and start by doing every other problem with your child. Asking your child for help on one of your problems can give your child confidence.

**Find the minimal dose**

Another way to find the minimum &quot;dose&quot; is to give the smallest version of an assignment tied to a small reward. You can either do this with a timer or a piece of the problem. For my oldest son, I often used my phone timer and had him do alternating &quot;work&quot; and &quot;play&quot; blocks to figure this out. If he worked, for example, for 5 minutes, he could have 5 minutes of resuming a video he was watching. When he was around 6 years old, I found that he could do over 30 minutes of work if we kept alternating between work and play. Most importantly, he was engaged and enjoying the whole period. This built up his confidence, which is a surprisingly underrated educational asset. Those 30-minute blocks of work quickly added up and my son found that he felt practiced in those areas. For a child who is fearful of work, a parent may have to make the choice – is it worth having a greater total time of work when added up, or one large block in which the child gives up early, and may end up not having any time at all?

**Enjoy the process**

Early on, I rewarded the kids for a completed assignment and the number they got correct. This was the most straightforward approach, but I found the kids were often playing tricks to get the right answer. On the other hand, my wife and I often had our two sons pestering us with questions to help them figure out the problems so they wouldn&#39;t get one wrong.

Every parent&#39;s goal is to foster independence in their children, and fostering independent problem-solving for academic work has the additional benefit of freeing up a parent&#39;s time. We found one strategy that worked consistently: rather than emphasizing the right answer, we split up the problem to reward not only the final answer, but also watching the accompanying instructional video and showing their work on paper. In fact, without doing the last two, they would not be able to collect the majority of their reward. It was, for lack of a better term, leaving money on the table.

In my experience, one of the core reasons that children fear schoolwork is often expressed by themselves in great frustration with the words &quot;I don&#39;t know how to do it!&quot; It is easy for a parent to hear this as saying, &quot;I don&#39;t want to do it&quot; or &quot;you can&#39;t make me do it&quot;. Instead, by emphasizing the process of how to solve a problem – any problem – we can help them learn steps they can use before seeking help or becoming so frustrated that they stop working.

Our three general steps we tell children for problem solving:

1. Have a sheet of paper and write down your steps
2. Rewind the tape and try an easier problem
3. Watch the instructional video at least three times to understand a concept.

Rather than &quot;eureka&quot; moments, we stress repetition and transparency in their learning approach. We want them to be able to explain why they are wrong and show their process instead of being caught up in the emotions of something &quot;they just can&#39;t get&quot;.

**Tie with something they are good at**

I told my son that if he had a shark mindset with his schoolwork, he would have confidence in many other areas of his life. He shrugged this off initially, but as he began to gain confidence in his ability to sit with problems, absorb the tension, and follow a process, I noticed improvements in other areas of his life. He was more diligent with his chores, especially completing them. My wife noticed that he was more outgoing in talking to peers at the bus stop. In school, he came home with reports on how he went after a problem, rather than silence or avoiding them. To my son&#39;s own surprise, he started winning matches in an online tournament game he played. In his own words, &quot;he felt like he could do anything&quot;.

I think this is because you are not really teaching a child how to do math or how to read. You are giving them an approach and emphasizing that problems are a big part of everyday life, and it is the strategies that you select that are the most important factor in achieving success. A child who believes that different strategies lead to different outcomes is in a much better position than one that thinks they need a brain &quot;transplant&quot;!

**Developing Muscle Memory**

Once you start this process, there is no doubt you will run into a few challenges! I often describe the first three steps as &quot;dose&quot; finding. You are trying your best to get in the ball park of what your child can tolerate. Sometimes you might underdose – your child may finish an assignment to quickly or find it too easy – but far too often we are just right above the right dose. A child often has a hard time telling the difference between &quot;much more&quot; difficult and &quot;a little bit&quot; more difficult – so their reaction will be the same.

How do we troubleshoot this? First, stay encouraged – you may be closer than you think! Observe your child and break down tasks into the smallest possible steps. Once you find a step that you think is just right, support your child in trying that step. Then, repeat the process as many times as it takes for your child to ask to move on. Kids love new things, and the more you repeat a step, the more their natural instinct will be to master the step and to move forward.

If you are working on a math assignment, for example, a child may give up when doing two-digit addition. Just moving to one digit addition is too big of a step down. Instead, work with your child on just solving the right most column of the addition problem several times and showing where to put the carry over. Repeat only this step and reward the child for sticking with it. If you are learning how to spell, do not hesitate to work on a few words at a time until the child feels very confident. This might be the difference between studying 4 words or 2 words, but to a struggling child it may make all the difference.

**One step forward and two steps back**

Children cannot really be programmed. Real life is messy. I know this is obvious, but it is a reminder that the human brain is very tough to change. Fear is a basic emotion that is associated with survival and danger, but it can also interfere with your functioning. Children (or adults) do not easily give up their fears. The process we have outlined above is really about building confidence and helping children begin to enjoy the process of conquering their fears by walking alongside their parents or caregivers. Eventually a child will again reach a &quot;hill&quot; that seems just too difficult to climb. Or more commonly, a child may be just too hungry, tired, or lonely to have the reserve necessary to mount a courage response to challenge.

This is expected and can be misunderstood by parents as a lack of progress or regression. Overcoming a fear means having your emotions, body, and mind in concert. It is no small feat! Children who do this once should be given encouragement so they realize that the next time they come to a crossroads they can overcome it. When a child &quot;stumbles&quot;, it is good to return back to our troubleshooting steps:

1. Was the &quot;dose&quot; too big?
2. Does the child have a process for getting the answer?
3. Have they tasted success?
4. Do they not have enough reserve because they are tired, hungry, or lonely?

The next time you raise the challenge, try out your best guess and see if answering one of these questions helps. Over time, you will develop a great sense of what your child needs to keep moving forward.

**Red flag symptoms**

As a physician, I also want to give you some things to watch out for if you and your child are struggling with this process. If your child&#39;s symptoms of fear are extreme, including physical aggression and self-harm, it is appropriate for you to seek outside resources such as through your pediatrician or a behavioral therapist. For some children, the emotions and stress may just be too &quot;big&quot; to get the process started. I often find that children whom therapy and/or medication may help have excessive fear and anxiety in other areas of their life as well. They may have difficulty getting together with friends or working independently. If a child is able to overcome their fear but you have noticed that they are unable to make that &quot;dose&quot; bigger, it is worthwhile to wonder if your child may have additional learning difficulties. These may include more general concerns about attention, but also may be very specific to the task like handwriting, or difficulty reading or doing mathematics. In this case, having a discussion with a pediatrician or seeking the services of an occupational therapist or physical therapist can assess a child&#39;s strengths and weaknesses. In cases where the child is significantly behind his grade-level, cognitive or educational testing would be recommended.

**Summary**

It can be easy to misdiagnose or overlook the symptoms of academic fear in a child, but if you can recognize the signs, there are steps you can take to help your child overcome this fear. These steps will help you to meet the child where they are and help them to build confidence and improve problem-solving skills. It is important to be patient throughout the process, and to return to the troubleshooting questions when you hit a bump in the road. I hope these strategies can help turn a struggling young learner into a shark!
